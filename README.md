# Counterexamples to Guth's Sponge Problem: 
# Stable Rigid Sphere Packings of Arbitrarily Low Density

We submit here some potential counterexamples to Larry Guth's Sponge Problem.
These examples were discussed in Jan 2021: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/381172/status-of-larry-guths-sponge-problem

The idea is to study the effect of expanding maps on sphere packings. 
We study sphere packings which have arbitrarily low densities, and find a sequence of such packings which cannot be expanded-embedded into the unit disk.
The sphere packings of interest are stable packings of arbitrarily low density. 
A sphere packing P is stable relative to a subset P' \subset P if there is no deformation of the packing P relative to the ambient space which is the identity on P'. The stable packings are globally structural and mechanically rigid. There is no possibility of continuously deforming a sphere without inducing a large deformation of the entire packing. Stable packings have no localized deformations, the only deformations are global! If any part of the packing is going to move, then all sphere in the packing need move.

The idea is based on Werner Fischer's constructions https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1524/zkri.2006.221.5-7.563/html of stable packings with small density.

In our estimation, the stable sphere packings of small density are effective counterexamples to Guth's Sponge Problem.
